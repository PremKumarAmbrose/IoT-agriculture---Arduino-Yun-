# IoT-agriculture-Arduino-Yun

This repository consists of all the files required to set up an IoT based automation in agriculture using Arduino-Yun board. In this project we have used different sensors like DHT sensor, soil moisture sensor, light sensor, water level sensor and rain detection sensor. Using these sensor I have made an automation system to water the crops using a water pump by monitoring the temperature, humidity, light intensity and soil moisture. In this project every reading of these sensors can be visualized through a web-page which is locally hosted by the Linux part of the Arduino Yun.
