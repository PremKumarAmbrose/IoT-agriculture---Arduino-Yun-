# Smart Agricultural System - IoT

This repository consists of all the files required to set up an IoT system, based on an Arduino Yun board, with the aim of managing the automatic irrigation of a small vegetable garden, basing on the detection of environmental parameters and the choice (by the user) of a particular crop to be managed, and to notify all the data and possible alarm situations through a dynamic and interactive web page and a mailing system. Arduino Yun works as a web server by locally storing in the microSD card.
